## Who is this for?
This repository is for:
-Beginners who want to learn Data Science
properly
-People who are confused by random tutorials 
-Learners who want to understand Python,Linux,
and Git togather
with this real-world projects.


## What you will learn

-Python programming(from basics to data
handling)
-Linux command line (real usage,no theory)
-Git & GitHub (how professionals work)
-Project structure for Data Science
-Clean coding habits

## Learning Philosophy
```markdown
this project focuses on:

-Understanding over shortcuts
-Learning by doing
-making mistakes and fixing them 
-Explaining every step clearly

This project is built for learners who want to:

-Understand *why* things work
-Learn by doing,not copying 
-Practice Git like real developers 
-Make mistakes and fix them properly


## Project Structure 

This project follows a simple and beginner-friendly
structure

```text 
data-science-from-scratch/
|
|--- main.py 
| Entry point for the project
| THis is where execution starts.
|
|--- utils.py
|  Helper functions and reusable logic.
|  Keep main.py clean and readable.
|
|--- requirements.txt
|  Lists all Python dependencies.
|  Allows anyone to recreate the environment.
|
|--- README.md 
| Project documentation and learning guide.
|
|--- .gitignore 
|  Telss Git which to ignore.
|  Prevents commiting generated or system file.


-Simple 
-No frameworks 
-No magic folders
-Easy to explain in enterviews
```
