# Data Science From Scratch

> Learn Data Science step by step using Python
## Who is this for?
This repository is for:
-Beginners who want to learn Data Science
properly
-People who are confused by random tutorials 
-Learners who want to understand Python,Linux,
and Git togather
with this real-world projects.


## What you will learn

-Python programming(from basics to data
handling)
-Linux command line (real usage,no theory)
-Git & GitHub (how professionals work)
-Project structure for Data Science
-Clean coding habits
